ASDF - four primary weapons
V - grenade launcher
Shift - switch gun to terraform and vice versa
space or < - switch to next gun

terraform gun should have limited uses?
replace raycast up for player with area2d cause it will never cover the entire head of player
while we're at it, the platforms dont seem to interact too well with it
make jump feel less heavy
