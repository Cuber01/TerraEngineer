You: Hello? Is anyone there? 
You: This is Jakub. Please respond.

You: Come on...
Radio: Status report.
You: I am so glad to hear from you, Mr. Henderson!
Henderson: Yes, I share your feelings. What happened?
You: We've been struck by the boche's on the way here. I am the only one who survived.
You: I managed to get to the coordinates you sent me and found the old bunker.
You: Nothing makes sense here. First I went into some offices, then a cave full of fauna and flora, and then there was an enormous tree empty inside. And inside of it there were more trees.
You: And the animals here... They're not... normal. They attacked me, I'm not feeling very well.
Henderson: You must get yourself together. We can't send you any help, we've been cut off from the east and west by enemy forces.
Henderson: It is of utmost importance you finish your mission, Jakub. We need you to extract all important archeo technology from that bunker.
Henderson: Report directly to me, and don't come back empty handed.
You:
>Yes sir!
>No. (locked)
